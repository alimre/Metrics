# Running the Model

## CAPA & non-CAPA Classification 

* **Data Loading**: We load the data labeled as CAPA and the non-CAPA elements and merge them in a single dataset to work with. 

* **Preprocessing**: The data has corrupted and/or missing values, we need to clean the data and set the correct format for all the elements entries (integer type, categorical values, timestamps, boolean values, etc).

* **Data Preparation**: The labels are encoded, the features to be used are set, the models to be trained are loaded, the dataset is split into train and test sets.

* **Model Training**: The models are trained and their respective metrics are obtained (confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall and f1 scores).

## CAPA Classification 

* **Data Loading**: We load the data labeled as CAPA. 

* **Preprocessing**: The data has corrupted and/or missing values, we need to clean the data as we did in the previous case, also we need to set the correct format for all the elements entries (integer type, categorical values, timestamps, boolean values, etc).

* **Data Preparation**: The labels are encoded, the features to be used are set, the models to be trained are loaded, the dataset is split into train and test sets as in the previous case.

* **Model Training**: The models are trained and their respective metrics are obtained (confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall and f1 scores).
